## axiomai.space: resesign from EduGenie, why and how: 

- I wanted to redesign the infrastructure of EduGenie and rebrand it to be a more scalable project, and focus a lot on design rather than just stringing everything together. Here is what I want to do:

  1. Retain original UI/UX from EduGenie.
  2. Key features:

    a. genies: a chat thread. use OpenRouter and allow user to pick the AI model they want to use.
    - have in-thread Resource generation capabilities (Videos, MindMaps, flashcards, create a google calendar event, etc.)
    - have a usable UI/UX design
    - scale in a way we can deploy really easily.
    b. Connection with Canvas LMS API and Google Calendar API (done for edugenie, can work on intergrating more use cases after thinking)
    - be able to pull courses, tasks, and assignments from canvas
    - be able to integrate with Google Calendar API
    c. Social aspect: be able to share class pages with friends, be able to customize their class pages to their liking (like Notion)
    d. Credit-based usage: each AI utility cots credits, user can buy credits or can purchase premium after free tier runs out.

  * and more that I have to think about and verbalize, but most of this is complete in EduGenie.
 


What to focus on: 
* really good design
* solidify tech stack: (NextJs+ flask; or t3 tech stack, or Express + Next or just plan React + fastAPI with websockets)
* follow OOD principles of good design, segregation, abstraction, etc.)
* Build something useable, that is built intelligently and can be shipped early to mid fall 2025.
